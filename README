This is the code for the Web sites interviewpalin.com,
interviewmccain.com, interviewbiden.com, and interviewobama.com.

Inspired by the incomprehensible rambling of Sarah Palin during her
Katie Couric interview, I decided to built a Markov chain based Palin
interview generator.  The result is surprising accurate, and, I think,
hilarious.

This code is based on code written by Siddhi (and others) which was
published at
http://siddhi.blogspot.com/2007/07/generating-sentences-using-markov.html

I made the code slightly more general as well as turned it into a Web
application via Twisted Python's twisted.web library.

My co-conspirators in this endeavor were:

* Kim Hagen - researched Palin's corpus and helped fine tune intial
      	      states

* Christopher Zorn - set up EC2 instance and offered his Twisted Python
  	      	     wisdom
