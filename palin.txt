That's why I say I, like every American I'm speaking with, we're ill
about this position that we have been put in where it is the taxpayers
looking to bail out. But ultimately what the bailout does is help
those who are concerned about the healthcare reform that is needed to
help shore up our economy. Helping the it's got to be all about job
creation too, shoring up our economy and putting it back on the right
track. So health care reform and reducing taxes and reining in
spending has got to accompany tax reductions and tax relief for
Americans and trade we've got to see trade as opportunity, not as
competitive, scary thing, but one in five jobs being created in the
trade sector today we've got to look at that as more opportunity.

He's also known as the maverick though. Taking shots from his own
party, and certainly taking shots from the other party. Trying to get
people to understand what he's been talking about the need to reform
government.

We have trade missions back and forth. We we do it's very
important when you consider even national security issues with Russia
as Putin rears his head and comes into the air space of the United
States of America, where where do they go? It's Alaska. It's just
right over the border. It is from Alaska that we send those out to
make sure that an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation,
Russia, because they are right there. They are right next to to our
state.

Well, it certainly does because our our next door neighbors are
foreign countries. They're in the state that I am the executive
of. And there in Russia

Diplomacy is about doing a lot of background work first and shoring up
allies and positions and figuring out what sanctions perhaps could be
implemented if things weren't gonna go right.

I thought yes, right off the bat. When he offered me the
position, as his running mate, the first thing I said to him was, if
you really think that I can help the ticket, if you really think I can
help this country, absolutely, I want to do this with you.

I answered him yes because I have the confidence in that readiness. And 
knowing that you can't blink. You have to be wired in a
way of being so committed to the mission, the mission that we're on,
reform of this country, and victory in the war. You can't blink. So, I
didn't blink then even, when asked to run as his running mate.

We got to remember what the desire is in this nation, at this time. It
is for no more politics as usual. And somebody's big, fat resume
maybe that shows decades and decades in that Washington establishment,
where, yeah, they've had opportunity to meet heads of state.

You know, there is a very small percentage of Islamic believers who
are extreme, and they are violent, and they do not believe in American
ideals. And they attacked us. And now we are at a point, here, seven
years later, on the anniversary, in this post-9/11 world, where we are
able to commit to never again. The only option for them is to become a
suicide bomber, to get caught up in this evil, in this terror. They
need to be provided the hope that all Americans have, instilled in us,
because we're a democratic, we are a free and we are a free-thinking
society.

As Putin rears his head and comes into the air space of the United
States of America, where do they go? It's Alaska. It's just right over
the border. It is from Alaska that we send those out to make sure that
an eye is being kept on this very powerful nation, Russia, because
they are right there, they are right next to our state.

He's got the track record of the leadership qualities and the
pragmatism that's needed at a crisis time like this.

I'm not looking at poll numbers. What I think Americans at the end of
the day are going to be able to go back and look at track records and
see who's more apt to be talking about solutions and wishing for and
hoping for solutions for some opportunity to change, and who's
actually done it?

That's something that John McCain and I have both been discussing
whether that is part of the solution or not. You know, it's going
to be a multi-faceted solution that has to be found here.

Consumers and those who were predator lenders also. That's, you
know, that has to be considered also. But again, it's got to be a
comprehensive, long-term solution found for this problem that
America is facing today. As I say, we are getting into crisis mode
here.

I think that the example that you just cited, with his warnings two
years ago about Fannie and Freddie - that, that's paramount. That's
more than a heck of a lot of other senators and representatives did
for us.

I can give you examples of things that John McCain has done, that has
shown his foresight, his pragmatism, and his leadership abilities. And
that is what America needs today.

I'll try to find you some and I'll bring them to you.

I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do is rid this
world of Islamic extremism, terrorists who are hell bent on destroying
our nation. There have been blunders along the way, though. There have
been mistakes made. And with new leadership, and that's the beauty of
American elections, of course, and democracy, is with new leadership
comes opportunity to do things better.

But it is about reform of government and it's about putting government
back on the side of the people, and that has much to do with foreign
policy and national security issues Let me speak specifically about a
credential that I do bring to this table, and that's with the
energy independence that I've been working on for these years as the
governor of this state that produces nearly 20 percent of the
U.S. domestic supply of energy, that I worked on as chairman of the
Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, overseeing the oil and gas
development in our state to produce more for the United States.

I want you to not lose sight of the fact that energy is a foundation
of national security. It's that important. It's that significant.

I have not and I think if you go back in history and if you ask that
question of many vice presidents, they may have the same answer that I
just gave you. But, again, we've got to remember what the
desire is in this nation at this time. It is for no more politics as
usual and somebody's big, fat resume maybe that shows decades and
decades in that Washington establishment, where, yes, they've had
opportunities to meet heads of state these last couple of weeks it has
been overwhelming to me that confirmation of the message that
Americans are getting sick and tired of that self-dealing and kind of
that closed door, good old boy network that has been the Washington
elite.

I don't know if the task is from God. What I know is that my
son has made a decision. I am so proud of his independent and strong
decision he has made, what he decided to do and serving for the right
reasons and serving something greater than himself and not choosing a
real easy path where he could be more comfortable and certainly safer.

First off, we're going to continue good relations with Saakashvili
there. I was able to speak with him the other day and giving him my
commitment, as John McCain's running mate, that we will be committed
to Georgia. And we've got to keep an eye on Russia. For Russia to have
exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic
country, unprovoked, is unacceptable and we have to keep.

 I do believe unprovoked and we have got to keep our eyes on Russia,
 under the leadership there. I think it was unfortunate. That
 manifestation that we saw with that invasion of Georgia shows us some
 steps backwards that Russia has recently taken away from the race
 toward a more democratic nation with democratic ideals.That's why we
 have to keep an eye on Russia.

And, you're in Alaska. We have that very narrow maritime
border between the United States, and the 49th state, Alaska, and
Russia. They are our next door neighbors.We need to have a good
relationship with them. They're very, very important to us and they
are our next door neighbor.

They're our next door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from
land here in Alaska, from an island in Alaska.

Well, I'm giving you that perspective of how small our world is and
how important it is that we work with our allies to keep good relation
with all of these countries, especially Russia. We will not repeat a
Cold War. We must have good relationship with our allies, pressuring,
also, helping us to remind Russia that it's in their benefit, also, a
mutually beneficial relationship for us all to be getting along.

And we have got to be vigilant. We have got to show the support, in
this case, for Georgia. The support that we can show is economic
sanctions perhaps against Russia, if this is what it leads to.

It doesn't have to lead to war and it doesn't have to lead, as I said,
to a Cold War, but economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, again,
counting on our allies to help us do that in this mission of keeping
our eye on Russia and Putin and some of his desire to control and to
control much more than smaller democratic countries.

His mission, if it is to control energy supplies, also, coming from
and through Russia, that's a dangerous position for our world to be
in, if we were to allow that to happen.

We have got to make sure that these weapons of mass destruction, that
nuclear weapons are not given to those hands of Ahmadinejad, not that
he would use them, but that he would allow terrorists to be able to
use them. So we have got to put the pressure on Iran and we have got
to count on our allies to help us, diplomatic pressure.

We need to pursue those and we need to implement those. We cannot back
off. We cannot just concede that, oh, gee, maybe they're going to have
nuclear weapons, what can we do about it. No way, not Americans. We do
not have to stand for that.

I believe that America has to exercise all options in order to stop
the terrorists who are hell bent on destroying America and our
allies. We have got to have all options out there on the table.

I think our presence in Iraq and Afghanistan will lead to further
security of our nation, again, because the mission is to take the
fight over there. do not let them come over here and attempt again
what they accomplished here, and that was some destruction. terrible
destruction on that day. but since September 11, Americans uniting and
rebuilding and committing to never letting that happen again.

I agree with the Bush administration that we take the fight to
them. We never again let them come onto our soil and try to destroy
not only our democracy, but communities like the community of New
York. Never again. So yes, I do agree with taking the fight to the
terrorists and stopping them over there.
