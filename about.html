    <h1>About These Interviews</h1>

    <p>This site is a parody.  The answers are computer generated based on
    probabilities calculated from Sarah Palin's actual speech. We think
    it is hilarious.</p>

    <p>The Markov chain generated answers are surprisingly close to her
    actual answers.  Don't believe me?  See below.</p>

    <h3>Actual Palin Interview Response</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>COURIC:</strong>Why isn't it better, Governor Palin, to
      spend $700 billion helping middle-class families struggling with
      health care, housing, gas and groceries? Allow them to spend
      more and put more money into the economy? Instead of helping
      these big financial institutions that played a role in creating
      this mess?
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>PALIN:</strong> That's why I say, I like ever American
      I'm speaking with were ill about this position that we have been
      put in where it is the tax payers looking to bailout.
    </p>
    <p> 
      But ultimately, what the bailout does is help those who are
      concerned about the health care reform that is needed to help
      shore up the economy - Helping the - Oh, it's got to be about job
      creation too. Shoring up our economy and putting it back on the
      right track. So health care reform and reducing taxes and
      reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions and tax
      relief for Americas.  And trade we've got to see trade as
      opportunity, not as a competitive scary thing. But 1 in 5 jobs
      being created in the trade sector today. We've got to look at
      that as more opportunity. All those things under the umbrella of
      job creation.  This bailout is a part of that.
